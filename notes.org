* To Do
** DONE Year heuristic :ARCHIVE:
CLOSED: [2018-09-26 Å›ro 16:45]
Logs have only month and day in the date. I need to add a year so if we sort by date, the lines from different years won't be jumbled up.
** TODO Concurrency?
** TODO Save all Undefined lines with a writer and then load it again and parse for emote
Then revise comment on [[file:LineParser.h::static%20bool%20ParseFile(const%20std::string&%20file_path,][LineParser::ParseFile()]] (specifically Warning)

*OR*
I should maybe write them to a temp file because of encapsulation rule.
** TODO Progress bar
